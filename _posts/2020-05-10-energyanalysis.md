# Energy Burdens by Metro Area
## 2017 American Community Survey (ACS)

**Intro**
For my final project in my "How to Think Like a Data Science Course" at Agnes Scott College (course built by Google), I completed an analysis on energy expenses in different metro areas.

**Code**
Click here to see the .html code file. The analysis was performed in Jupyter Notebook using Python.  

**Snippet**
Here's a snippet of my code:

Python code block:
```python
    import numpy as np

    def test_function(x, y):
      z = np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```

Here's an image of stacked data organized by metro area.
